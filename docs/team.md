# Dr Anchit Chandran, Founder

Anchit is an ex-doctor who graduated from Imperial College School of Medicine and Imperial Business School and is currently freelancing as a clinical software developer. He entered  Medicine to realise positive change on a societal level. However, working in the NHS, he experienced too many barriers and inefficiencies preventing large-scale sustainable change. 

His favourite language is Python, which he learned through self-teaching from online resources. Though anyone *can* learn to code for free, he founded MediCode when realising there were no tutorials catered to medics. He also has experience with languages such as HTML/CSS/JavaScript, R, and SQL. He holds an internship with Great Ormond Street Hospital's data science team, DRIVE, and is also freelancing as a clinical software developer for clients such as the RCPCH.

His main interests are data science and machine learning. His career aspirations involve applying computational methods to understand the mind, mental health, and consciousness.

# Kieran Vail

- Kieran is a Founder Associate at a pharmaceutical startup company. It may sound cliche, but he has always been passionate about science and using that passion to help people. But, he also loves problem-solving - so working in healthcare is quite an obvious choice for him. A few years ago he also fell in love with coding, so he is now lucky that he gets to combine the two in his current job! His favorite language is Python, he loves how much readability is built in. In his current role, he has been working on developing the company’s product, which is an end-to-end operations platform for pharmaceutical product license holders. He has been building the underlying data logic in python from the ground up, which has been a big challenge but super gratifying! Ultimately, he doesn’t know the exact direction he’d like to take his career, but he’s loving how generalist his current role is as it gives him a chance to try his hand at many different business areas.
